The Parser classes will have init params that calculate a mapping to the correct Google Reader URL. 

A list of all the URL mappings that we will support in the RSSReader:

List of Labels - LabelParser
	http://www.google.com/reader/api/0/tag/list


Feeds - FeedParser

Starred
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/starred
	
All
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/reading-list

Unread
???? - not sure if this does what we expect
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/fresh
	-- or --
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/reading-list?xt=user/-/state/com.google/read

Read
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/read
	
Kept-Unread
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/kept-unread
	
Public
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/state/com.google/broadcast

By Label
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user/-/label/{label}

By Site	
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/feed/{url of site's feed}
	
Any of the URL's of the form 
	http://www.google.com/reader/atom/
can have GET parameters passed to them. The ones that we care about are:
n - Number of items returns in a set of items (default 20)
r - order - By default, items starts now, and go back time. You can change that by specifying this key to the 
	value o (default value is d)
xt - exclude_target	- another set of items suffix, to be excluded from the query. For exemple, you can query all 
	items from a feed that are not flagged as read. This value start with feed/ or user/, not with !http:// or www
c -	continuation a - string used for continuation process. Each feed return not all items, but only a certain number 
	of items. You'll find in the atom feed (under the name gr:continuation) a string called continuation. 
	Just add that string as argument for this parameter, and you'll retrieve next items.
